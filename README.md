Implement Some Optimization Algorithm For Finding Minimal Point of Polynomial Curvel

## [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
In this document, I try to re-implement [GA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm),
based on my understanding about this method and [Genetic Algorithm Implementation in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/genetic-algorithm-implementation-in-python-5ab67bb124a6).

'''flow
st=>start: Start
op=>operation: Your Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?
e=>end
